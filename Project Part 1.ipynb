Feel free to modify this notebook as needed, but be sure to have the two main parts, a) a introductory proposal section describing what it is your doing to do and where the dataset originates, and b) an exploratory analysis section that has the histograms, charts, tables, etc. that are the output from your exploratory analysis. \n\n__Note you will want to remove the text above, and in the markdown cells below, and replace it with your own text describing the dataset, task, exploratory steps, etc.__","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 1. Introduction/Background\n\n_In this section you will describe (in English) the dataset you are using as well as the NLP problem it deals with. For example, if you are planning to use the Twitter Natural Disaster dataset, then you will describe what the data and where it came as if you were explaining it to someone who does not know anything about the data. You will then describe how this is a __text classification__ problem, and that the labels are binary (e.g. a tweet either refers to a genuine/real natural disaster, or it does not)._ \n\n_Overall, this should be about a paragraph of text that could be read by someone outside of our class, and they could still understand what it is your project is doing._ \n\n_Note that you should __not__ simply write one sentence stating, \"This project is base on the Kaggle competition: Predicting Natural Disasters with Twitter._\"\n\n_If you are still looking for datasets to use, consider the following resources to explore text datasets._\n\n* https://huggingface.co/datasets/\n* https://www.kaggle.com/datasets\n* https://data-flair.training/blogs/machine-learning-datasets/ \n* https://pytorch.org/text/stable/datasets.html\n* https://github.com/niderhoff/nlp-datasets \n* https://medium.com/@ODSC/20-open-datasets-for-natural-language-processing-538fbfaf8e38 \n* https://imerit.net/blog/25-best-nlp-datasets-for-machine-learning-all-pbm/ \n\n\n_If you instead are planning to do a more research-oriented or applied type of project, then describe what it is that you plan to do._\n\n_If it is research, then what do you want to understand/explain better?_\n\n_If it is applied, then what it is you plan to build?_ \n\nThe purpose of this project is to explore the effects of different hyperparameters, in terms of accuracy, on a few different possible models.

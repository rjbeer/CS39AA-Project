Though a higher accuracy was expected, and certainly it was acheived as neither of the base models from Part 2 of the project managed to get above 0.84, it was a surprise to see just how much more accurate the model ended up being as initial thoughts were sub 0.90.\n\nInstead accuracy ended up being approximately 0.934 with a loss of 0.2524. Though other hyperparameters were tested, due to time constraints only a handful of tests were able to be run. The hyperparameters that were primarily adjusted were num_train_epochs and eval_steps. In both cases neither increased the accuracy, although in both cases the total numbers were less than the current numbers above, that being 10 for num_train_epochs, and 200 for eval_steps. \n\nThe total time it took to reach the current accuracy was about ~24 minutes with average times for lower tested values being about ~16 minutes overall. \n\n\n# Conclusion\n\nThe pre-trained model was understandably more accurate than the adjusted base models by almost 0.1 accuracy. This was a surprise, not that the model was more accurate but by how much. The model did, however, take significantly more time to train and reach its results, although, that is to be expected as the model itself is more sofisticated with many more moving parts than the previous models used in part 2. \n\nTo improve further on the BERT model more testing with differing epochs (specifically > 10) or greater eval_steps (specifically > 200) would need to be tested to see what their impact would be. Similarly to further improve on the previous two models, that being RandomForestClassifier and HistGradientBoostingClassifier, layers could be added to improve their metrics, specifically accuracy, as well as potentially adjusting the hyperparameters further or perhaps hyperparameters that were not tested in varying configurations.","metadata":{}}]}
